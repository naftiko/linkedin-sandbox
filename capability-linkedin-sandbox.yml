        reach and ROI that LinkedIn can offer to their client. It allows them to
        make budget allocation recommendations with confidence and know how to
        improve the results, even before spending the first dollar. Media
        Planning API helps Media Planners make that decision by giving the
        forecasted reach, impressions (and more in future, like clicks, leads)
        curve over the budget, based on inputs provided like targeted audience,
        campaign start/end date and more.Note: This is a private API that is
        available to qualified developers who meet additional criteria for
        access. To learn more about eligibility qualifications and how to

        requires a [3-legged
        OAuth](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow)
        member token and your developer application needs to be provisioned with
        the Media Planning API product. Once you have been approved to access,
        you can use any valid member access token associated with the
        authenticated user with any valid scope permissions for member
        authentication. If there is no valid member token for the relevant user
        from any previous integration, we recommend using the bare minimum scope
        permissions like `r_ads` which will be required to fetch authenticated
        user's ad accounts.  Note: This API is application-specific; hence,
        explicit member consent is not required. Any valid member access token
        associated with the authenticated user can be used, and you do not need
        to add any additional permission in the scope of your Oauth2 flow for
        authorization.This collection aims to focus on different Media Planning

    - title: Media Planning
      description: >-
        ## OverviewMedia Planning API can help Media Planners understand the
        reach and ROI that LinkedIn can offer to their client. It allows them to
        make budget allocation recommendations with confidence and know how to
        improve the results, even before spending the first dollar. Media
        Planning API helps Media Planners make that decision by giving the
        forecasted reach, impressions (and more in future, like clicks, leads)
        curve over the budget, based on inputs provided like targeted audience,
        campaign start/end date and more.Note: This is a private API that is
        available to qualified developers who meet additional criteria for
        access. To learn more about eligibility qualifications and how to
        request access, please see the
        [FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/lms-faq#how-do-i-get-access-to-media-planning-api-product).
        If you wish to apply for access, please submit a [Zendesk support
        ticket](https://linkedin.zendesk.com/).## PermissionsMedia Planning API
        requires a [3-legged
        OAuth](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow)
        member token and your developer application needs to be provisioned with
        the Media Planning API product. Once you have been approved to access,
        you can use any valid member access token associated with the
        authenticated user with any valid scope permissions for member
        authentication. If there is no valid member token for the relevant user
        from any previous integration, we recommend using the bare minimum scope
        permissions like `r_ads` which will be required to fetch authenticated
        user's ad accounts.  Note: This API is application-specific; hence,
        explicit member consent is not required. Any valid member access token
        associated with the authenticated user can be used, and you do not need
        to add any additional permission in the scope of your Oauth2 flow for
        authorization.This collection aims to focus on different Media Planning
        use cases and should be used with the **media-planning-env-versioning**
        environment.\--All requests for the Media Planning API collection are in
